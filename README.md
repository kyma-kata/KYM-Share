## Kym Share Repro

A collection of various kym files collected over the years from old Kyma forum, wiki, and public shares.  No rights claimed. If there is a file here that shouldn't be, please let us know and we'll remove.

Most files lack documentation and attribution. Some files may only work with specific hardware or firmware versions.  Examples include very old files that use User Microsounds for the Capybara and newer sounds that may assume Kyma 7 software.  

Submissions welcome. Either add to the appropriate folders, dump into the "unorganized" folder, or contact one of kata members for assistance.

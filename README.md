# KYM-Share
A collection of various kym files collected over the years.

Sources include old forums and public websites.  No rights claimed. If there is a file here that shouldn't be, please let us know and we'll remove.

Some files may only work with specific hardware or firmware versions.  Examples include very old files that use User Microsounds for the Capybara and newer sounds that may assume Kyma 7 software.  

Notes:
There is a massive folder for all kyma files.  No promise they work or have documenation.  Please contribute to the collection.

To do:
Add folder structure.

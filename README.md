## Kym Share Repro

A collection of various kym files collected over the years from old Kyma forum, wiki, and public shares.

Most files lack documentation and attribution. Some may not run properly.

Submissions welcome. Either add to the appropriate folders, dump into the "unorganized" folder, or contact one of kata members for assistance.
